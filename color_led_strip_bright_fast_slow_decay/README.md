# LED Color strip with Motion Sensor
Code for a Micro Arduino controller for a Neopixel addressable LED strip.
Uses a HC-SR04 ultrasonic detector with a range threshold to activate.
No  light sensor is included. It is active day and night. 

# TODO
- Use a PIR sensor instead of ultrasonic.
- Deactivate (ultra low power) until low light. Photodiode and resistor is fine.
- A few other things.
